# CorCenCC project overview and how to cite

CorCenCC (Corpws Cenedlaethol Cymraeg Cyfoes – the National Corpus of Contemporary Welsh)  is an inter-disciplinary and multi-institutional project that has created a large-scale, open-source corpus of contemporary Welsh. The CorCenCC corpus contains over 11 million words (circa 14 million tokens) from written, spoken and electronic (online, digital texts) Welsh language sources, taken from a range of genres, language varieties (regional and social) and contexts. The contributors to CorCenCC are representative of the over half a million Welsh speakers in the country.
